# React list of goods

> [React + Typescript cheat sheet](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/js/extra/react-typescript)

You a given an array of goods. Render them as a list in the App after `Start` button click.

1. Show only the `Start` button at the beginning.
1. After the `Start` button click, hide it and show the list and other buttons.
1. `Sort alphabetically` button should sort the goods alphabetically.
1. `Sort by length` button should sort the goods by length.
1. `Reverse` button changes the current order to the opposite one. It should work with any sorting.
1. `Reset` button should show the goods in the initial order.

## (Optional) Advanced tasks (require understanding of Forms in React)
1. Add `<select>` with a `minLength` numbers from 1 to 10. (1 is default). All the previous buttons
  should now show only the goods at least `minLength` long. When you change the
  value the items should be immediately re-rendered accordingly.
2. `Reset` button should set the default value to the `<select>`
3. Add some styles, you are frontend developer :) (use [Bulma](https://bulma.io) or another library)
- [Center elements](https://bulma.io/documentation/layout/level/)
- [Customize buttons](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/button/)
