# React list of goods

Implement the ability to reorder the goods with the given buttons.

> Here is [the working version](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_list-of-goods/)

1. `Sort alphabetically` button should sort the goods alphabetically.
    - remove `is-light` class from the button when this order is applied;
1. `Sort by length` button should sort the goods by length.
    - remove `is-light` class from the button when this order is applied;
1. `Reverse` button changes the current order to the opposite one.
    - it should work together with any sorting;
    - remove `is-light` class from the button when goods are reversed;
    - the second click should show goods in the direct order;
1. `Reset` button should show the goods in the initial order.
    - it should be visible only if goods are not already in the original order;
