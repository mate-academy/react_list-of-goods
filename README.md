# React list of goods
- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://Sardorbek1122.github.io/react_list-of-goods/)
- Follow the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline)
- Use [React TypeScript cheat sheet](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/js/extra/react-typescript)

## Tasks
1. At first show a button with text `Start` on the page
2. Clicking the button shows a `GoodsList` (ul > li) with the given goods and hides the `Start` button
3. Add button with text `Reverse` to show the goods in reversed order
4. Add button with text `Sort alphabetically` to show the goods in alphabetical order
5. Add button with text `Reset` to show the goods in the initial order
6. Add button with text `Sort by length` to show the goods ordered by name length

## (*) Advanced tasks (require understanding of Forms in React)
1. Add `<select>` with numbers from 1 to 10. (1 is default). All the previous buttons
  should now show only goods having length >= than the selected value. When you change the
  value the items should be immediately re-rendered accordingly.
2. `Reset` button should set the default value to the `<select>`
3. Add some styles, you are frontend developer :) (use [Bulma](https://bulma.io) or another library)
- [Center elements](https://bulma.io/documentation/layout/level/)
- [Customize buttons](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/button/)
